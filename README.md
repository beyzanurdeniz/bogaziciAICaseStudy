## Predictive Analysis of Diabetes Risk Using Patient Health Data
<hr>

### <ins>Background and Objective</ins>
Early prediction can help in managing and preventing complications of diabetes. This case involves building a predictive model to identify the risk of diabetes in patients using patient health data. The objective is to predictive model to assess the risk of diabetes in patients. The model should be able to predict the risk of diabetes based on health parameters.
<br>
<br>
Objective is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a pa ent developing diabetes. 
This model will help in identifying individuals at high risk and facilitate early intervention.

### <ins>Dataset</ins>
Dataset used is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data">Pima Indians Diabetes Database</a>: 
<li>This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.</li>
<li>The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.</li>
